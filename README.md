## Replicate Hollow Knight for OOP project 
Hollow knight is one of my favorite games. From the ambiance to the sound design, everything is intricately designed. Hence for my Object orient programming project, I tried replicating the game. While i wasn't able to fully build a workable model i enjoyed hours of coding to get all animations to work.
